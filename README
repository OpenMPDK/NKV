#This README file will help user to get familiar with high level directory structure of the NKV client library stack.

Root Directory structure contains the following..

  README_INSTALL.txt  --> README for the installation and run test application on top of KV device(s)
  README              --> README for NKV project
  config              --> Sample config file to run NKV app
  build.sh            --> Script for Building entire NKV stack (including openmpdk) 
  spec                --> NKV spec document for application Integration
  include             --> Header files for application Integration
  src                 --> NKV library source code
  CMakeLists.txt      --> Cmake file (will be invoked by build.sh script)

'src' directory is containing the following..

  include_private     --> Include files for internal use
  nkv_api.cpp         --> Library entry point
  test                --> Directory containing sample test application code
  nkv_framework.cpp   --> Library framework implementation 
  openmpdk            --> openmpdk is the Samsung opensource driver code base for communicating with
                          local KV devices. Added as submodule here.
  logger              --> Log wrapper on top of log4cpp, log4cpp is added as submodule underneath

Building NKV
 go to source directory
 and run the following: ./build.sh kdd
 the above build will create build directory "$cwd../$cmdname_out" for build output and builds it.
 build generates nkv bins "nkv-sdk-bin-TIMESTAMP.tgz" which contains shared libraries and cli test tool
 The above shared libraries are used to integrate with MINIO S3 APP server, refer minio for more info https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/nkv/docs/nkv/README.md
