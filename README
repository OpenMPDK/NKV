### Building SDK for Samsung KV Device(s)
#### Prerequisites
   Build depends on the following packages: cmake,boost-devel,numactl-devel,tbb-devel
#### Build Steps
   clone the source with --recursive option to bring all dependant submodules
   go to source directory
   and run the following: ./build.sh kdd
   the above build script creates build directory, just above current working directory with appending **_out** and builds under it. ex)"NKV/../NKV_out"
   build generates nkv bins "nkv-sdk-bin-TIMESTAMP.tgz" which contains shared libraries and cli test tool
   The above shared libraries are used to integrate with MINIO S3 APP server, refer [minio](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/nkv/docs/nkv/README.md) for more info
